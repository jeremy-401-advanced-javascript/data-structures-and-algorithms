# Challenge Summary
Instantiate a Linked List.

## Challenge Description
Create and Instantiate a Linked List with values with using a append method with append values to the end of linked list.
insert method inserts a value at the beginning of a linked list 
includes method traverses a linked list and searches for a given value
toString method converts a values to a string.
insertBefore method will insert a value before a given node. 
insertAfter method will insert a value after a given node.

## Approach & Efficiency
Traversal of Linked list using while loop is O(N). The assignment operators are O(1).

## Solution
[Singly Linked-List](https://github.com/jeremy-401-advanced-javascript/data-structures-and-algorithms/pull/13)

# Challenge Summary
Creat a method that returns a value traversing from the end of linked list.

## Challenge Description
Insert a number into a function it should traverse the linked list and return a value. Starting postion of value should be from the of the linked list counting back towards the beginning. If number exceeds the length of the linked list return undefined.

## Approach & Efficiency
Traversal of Linked list using while loop is O(N). The assignment operators are O(1).

## Solution

# Challenge Summary
Merge two Linked list

## Challenge Description
Merging to Linked List together, instantiating one Linked List from the the both Linked list.

## Approach & Efficiency
Traversal of both linked list using a while loop is O(N). The assignment operators are O(1).

## Solution

# Challenge Summary
Tree fizzBuzz

## Challenge Description
Make a method that traverses a tree and returns an evaluation. If the number is divisible by 3 and 5 return fizzbuzz, else if a value is divisible by 5 return buzz, else if a number is divisible by e return fizz, else return the value as is.

## Approach & Efficiency

Traversal of both linked list using a while loop is O(N). The assignment operators are O(1).
